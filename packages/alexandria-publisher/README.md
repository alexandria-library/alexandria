The publisher plugins exist in a different repo.

If using one of these plugins it would be a good idea to still publish a proper Alexandria website.

Publisher plugins (I will not be making these. If you make one it would be great if you add it as a package here).
* Confluence
* Drupal
* Wordpress
* Some CMS
* Generic DB
